The film barely saw any footfalls until the afternoon shows, and only picked up a little pace over the evening and night shows. As per the industry tracker Sacnilk, the film managed to earn Rs 1.25 crore (early estimates) on Friday. The three national chains - PVR, Inox, and Cinepolis - contributed to Rs 85 lakh, which accounts for 60 percent of the total business of Tejas on day one, reported Bollywood Hungama. The overall Hindi occupancy of the film was 6.83%, which isn't a good sign. With an opening like this, it becomes crucial for Tejas to pick up the pace over the weekend if it wants to stay airborne. But as things stand, Tejas has a strong chance of becoming Kangana's fifth Hindi-language flop in a row, after Dhaakad (2022), which had an opening of Rs 0.55 cr, Thalaivi (2021), that earned Rs 0.32 cr on the day of its release, Panga (2020), and Judgementall Hai Kya (2019). The last time the actor had some luck with the box office numbers was when her historical drama Manikarnika hit theatres in 2019. She was last seen in the Tamil-language film Chandramukhi 2. The other military drama of RSVP Movies which has also bankrolled Tejas, Uri: The Surgical Strike had earned Rs 8.20 cr on the day of its opening day in 2019. Tejas failed to impress critics as well. The Indian Express' Shubhra Gupta felt that the film revolved around Kangana, at the cost of the story. She wrote in her review, ""The trouble with this kind of film which is so intent upon keeping the main star centre-stage that everyone else ends up as satellites. The relationship between Tejas and her co-pilot (Anshul Chauhan) has its moments– especially one in which the two are chatting about boyfriends and two-timing, and a couple of others meant to be humorous, making light of a tough situation– but it is always clear that it is Tejas who is calling the shots.""","kangana ranaut, tejas, tejas box office, tejas movie, tejas movie box office, kangana box office, tejas day 1 box office, tejas box office collection, tejas movie release, bollywood box office, box office,"

Next meeting scheduled for Nov 6, giving members another week to review draft report.","The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affair postponed its adoption of a draft report on three Bills seeking to replace the existing criminal laws, after pressure from the Opposition seeking more time to examine it. According to sources, the English version of the draft report was circulated just last week and the Hindi version was sent to members of the Parliamentary panel only on Thursday evening, just hours before the adoption of the report was slated at Friday’s meeting of the panel. According to sources, three members — Congress MPs Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary and Digivijay Singh, along with Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MP N.R. Elango — have so far filed dissent notes. They are demanding several changes in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 that will replace the Indian Penal Code, and the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 that will replace the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). More dissent notes are expected to follow. Draft report accepts Hindi namesOne of the key points of contention, the Hindi nomenclature of the Bills, has not been accepted in the draft reports circulated so far. The panel’s report on the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, states that since the text of the Bill is in English, it does not violate the provisions of Article 348 of the Constitution, which says that the language to be used in the Supreme Court and High Courts as well as for Acts, Bills, and other legal documents shall be English.The panel’s draft report has accepted a host of suggestions on the Bharatiya Sakshya, 2023 that is meant to replace the Indian Evidence Act; there is unanimity on that portion of the draft report. The panel began its consultations on the three bills on August 24, with a presentation by Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla. Including Friday’s meeting, it has held 12 meetings on the three Bills. According to Opposition members, this is highly inadequate, considering the scale and scope of the Bills. ‘Stop bulldozing Bills’According to sources, a few minutes after Friday’s meeting began, the panel’s chairman and BJP MP Brijlal told the members that the draft reports slated to be adopted at the meeting as per the circulated agenda would be withheld. However, he did not state the reason for doing so, members said. This drew sharp criticism from the two Trinamool Congress MPs Derek O’ Brien and Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, who pointed out that they had came to Delhi, leaving Lakshmi Puja which is on October 28, in order to attend the meeting. In fact, the TMC, in a letter on to Mr. Brijlal on Friday morning, demanded that the committee seek an extension of at least three months to submit its report on the Bills. The party urged the panel to “stop bulldozing these Bills for short-term electoral gains.”  Hurrying through the Bills would amount to mocking the process of “legislative scrutiny”,  the two MPs said. Earlier, Congress MP P. Chidambaram had also written to the committee, asking for more time and increased consultations.  Consultations beyond DelhiSpeaking at Friday’s meeting, Mr. Elango raised three key points, according to the sources. The Bills, he said, need extensive consultations with the governments and stakeholders in the States. He once again reiterated his criticism of the Hindi nomenclature of the Bills, which he said was exclusionary for a large section of the country. The Bills are largely a copy of the existing codes which could have been amended instead of bringing in new legislation, he added.The panel has scheduled its next meeting for November 6, giving the members another week to review the draft report and submit their suggestions. A BJP member said that the committee was of the view that the draft report should be ready in time for the Winter Session of Parliament. ","parliamentary panel,criminal laws ,home affairs,draft report on bills replacing criminal laws ,criminal law in india,criminal law amendment,Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 ,Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023,IPC"

She denied allegations of taking bribes from Mr Hiranandani and demanded that she be given the chance to cross-examine him, in an interview to India Today.

Her remarks come amid allegations that she received gifts from Mr Hiranandani in exchange for asking questions in Parliament. The Ethics committee of the parliament has summoned her to present her defence on October 31 but Ms Moitra has requested more time due to ""pre-committed programmes"" in her constituency Krishnanagar. Most members of the Ethics committee have said the charges against Ms Moitra are serious in nature and amount to a breach of parliamentary privilege. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey and Delhi-based lawyer Jai Anant Dehadrai have already recorded their statements and presented evidence against the Trinamool MP.

Ms Moitra on Friday also lashed out against Mr Dehadrai, citing that he did not deserve the national importance he was getting. She also said his complaint against her was motivated by the acrimonious custody battle that both were fighting over their pet dog Henry.

Ms Moitra defended sharing login credentials with Mr Hiranandani saying she has done that with others too ""as she worked from a remote constituency."" ""But there is always an OTP and the team would always post my questions,"" she said, claiming that the NIC that operates government and parliamentary websites had no rules against this.

This was countered by Mr Dubey in a tweet in which he posted the rules specified by the NIC and a form that every parliamentarian was obligated to fill out. These include instructions to keep the credentials private and confidential and inform the NIC of any alternate user as any breach could have security implications.

Mr Dubey also demanded a probe into the attempts that he claimed were being made to influence Mr Hiranandani and if Ms Moitra was in touch with him. Mr Hiranandani is an approver in this case with his signed affidavit corroborating the charges raised against Ms Moitra by both Mr Dubey and Mr Dehadrai.

Ms Moitra said the things she had received from the businessman, who she called a close personal friend, were a scarf for her birthday present, lipsticks, and makeup items from Bobbi Brown. She said that the makeup products were brought for her from Dubai's duty-free store. She also said she had consulted him for changing the interiors of her house, and he had presented her with new architectural plans and drawings, but the expenses were undertaken by the CPWD which comes under the government.

""When I was allotted my personal bungalow, it was in a dilapidated state. I asked Darshan if he could get one of his architects how the doors can be re-designed so light can come in,"" said Ms Moitra, showing pictures of designs sent to her by Mr Hiranandani's architects for the bungalow's rooms, layout, and kitchen. She said that the designs were submitted to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) and claimed that her bungalow's renovation was done by the government body. She also said whenever she was in Mumbai, she would use Mr Hiranandani's car as he was a friend.

""I would urge Darshan Hiranandani to come immediately and put on record if he has given anything else to me. Anyone can make an allegation, but the onus is always on the complainant to prove those allegations. There's no mention of Rs 2 crore cash given to me in the affidavit. If cash is being given, please tell the date and provide all the documentary evidence,"" she said.","Mahua Moitra,Darshan Hiranandani"

CNN —

A US Army reservist accused of killing 18 people and injuring 13 others in a shooting rampage in Maine this week was found dead Friday evening – apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot – after a two-day manhunt, a state official said.

Robert Card, accused of committing Wednesday’s massacre at a bowling alley and a restaurant in Lewiston, Maine, was found dead around 7:45 p.m. Friday near the Androscoggin River in the Lisbon Falls area, some 10 miles Lewiston, state Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck told reporters.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills said she is “breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that … Card is no longer a threat to anyone.”

“Now is a time to heal,” Mills, who said Maine State Police found the body, told reporters at the news conference. “Tonight, the city of Lewiston and the state of Maine begin to move forward on a long road to healing.”

Card’s body was found in an area near a recycling center from which he had recently been fired, a law enforcement source told CNN. Earlier this week, authorities had found Card’s vehicle abandoned after the shooting near a boat launch in the Lisbon area.

Details about when Card died still were being investigated, Sauschuck said, and authorities haven’t announced a motive in the shooting. Authorities intend to release more information Saturday morning about Card and the investigation, they said.

The discovery of Card’s body ends an intense two-day search that saw hundreds of officers scour parts of southern Maine by land, water and air, and finishes a period in which communities were simultaneously grieving and riddled with anxiety about the suspect’s location. Shelter-in-place orders for Androscoggin and northern Sagadahoc counties were in place from Wednesday night until they were lifted Friday afternoon, and schools, businesses and facilities were closed much of that time.

Part of the reason the search for Card was expanded to waterways: Authorities found a note from Card that indicated that he did not expect to be alive when the note was found, a law enforcement official told CNN.

The note essentially gave information to others about where things could be found and how things could be disposed of, the official said. Authorities had executed at least three search warrants Thursday on his vehicle, home and another property, the source said, which informed their search procedures Friday.

Wednesday evening’s shooting was the deadliest US mass shooting since last year’s massacre at a school in Uvalde, Texas.

Sources: Suspect bought gun legally days before psychiatric evaluation

Earlier Friday, multiple law enforcement sources told CNN the gun investigators believe Card used to carry out the massacre was purchased legally just days before he was hospitalized and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation in July.

In mid-July, New York State Police were called to Camp Smith in Cortlandt, New York, the military base where Card served, because he was acting “belligerently and possibly intoxicated,” according to a source briefed on the matter. Three law enforcement sources confirm state police brought Card to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for suspected intoxication and released the next day. When asked for information about the encounter, a New York State Police spokesperson told CNN: “This is an active investigation, and the New York State Police does not comment on active investigations.”

A federal law enforcement source told CNN the army gave Card a “Command Referral” to seek treatment after he told army personnel at Camp Smith Card had been “hearing voices” and had thoughts about “hurting other soldiers.” A National Guard spokesperson confirmed to CNN Card was transported to the nearby Keller Army Community Hospital at the United States Military Academy for “medical evaluation,” after Army Reserve officials reported Card for “behaving erratically.”

Card’s encounters with New York State Police and his National Guard superiors occurred just 10 days after Card had purchased the high-powered rifle at a Maine gun store, according to law enforcement sources. The rifle was a Ruger SFAR chambered for high-powered .308 ammunition, the sources added. The .308 round is favored by military snipers firing at long distances and big game hunters. It is larger and more powerful than the regular ammunition carried in the rifles of soldiers and SWAT teams.

Sources say the weapon found inside Card’s 2013 white Subaru Outback appears to be the same one fired by the gunman at the bowling alley and a local bar, though a ballistics match has not been confirmed. The weapon will be processed by the FBI and ATF for fingerprints and DNA and then run through laboratory testing to determine if the bullets and shell casings found at the scene match.

In the same July purchase, along with the rifle, sources say Card also bought a Beretta 92-F 9mm semi-automatic pistol. It is the standard pistol of the US military.

Deceased victims were 14 to 76 years old

The horror began around 7 p.m. Wednesday in Lewiston, where authorities say Card opened fire at Just-in-Time Recreation and then later at Schemengees Bar & Grille. Police were on the scene within just minutes of 911 calls made from the shooting locations, they said.

In addition to the 18 people killed, 13 others were injured, the Maine governor said Thursday.

Authorities identified all deceased victims Friday and said all their families had been notified. The oldest killed was a 76-year-old man and the youngest was a 14-year-old boy bowling with his father.

The victims are Tricia Asselin, William Frank Brackett, Peyton Brewer-Ross, Thomas “Tommy” Conrad, Michael Deslauriers II, Jason Walker, Keith Macneir, Bryan MacFarlane, Ronald “Ron” Morin Arthur “Artie” Strout, Joseph “Joey” Walker, Joshua Seal, Maxx Hathaway, Robert “Bob” Violette, Lucille Violette, Stephen “Steve” Vozzella, William “Bill” Young and his son Aaron Young.

Sources: Investigators developed working theory on why locations were targeted

Authorities searched two days across southern Maine for the suspect. Before Card’s body was found, authorities Friday still were urging residents across a 700-square-mile area to be vigilant as authorities raced to apprehend him.

Live Updates: Manhunt continues after Maine shooting rampage

Before Card was found dead, investigators had recovered a cell phone that belonged to Card, a law enforcement official said Friday. It added to the challenges for investigators, who routinely track cell phones to find suspects.

During the search, a CNN team saw officers surrounding a greenhouse late Friday morning at Springworks Farm in Lisbon, which is less than a mile from a boat launch where Card’s vehicle was found. Officers cleared the scene by noon.

And while the motive for the massacre remained unannounced Friday evening, a key theory about why the bowling alley and the restaurant were targeted emerged during the investigation, law enforcement sources say.

Card recently broke up with a longtime girlfriend, and investigators are pursuing a theory that Card went to the bowling alley and the bar because they were places the couple used to frequent, law enforcement sources told CNN’s John Miller.

Investigators believe the ex-girlfriend had signed up to play in a tournament at the bar Wednesday night, the sources said. According to the Facebook page for Schemengees Bar and Grill, Wednesday is “Industry Night,” which draws employees from other bars and restaurants in the Lewiston area.

Now that authorities know Card is dead, a hunting restriction that was in place for four communities because of the manhunt has been lifted, Sauschuck said Friday night. The lifting of the restriction in Lewiston, Lisbon, Bowdoin and Monmouth comes in time for Saturday’s opening of Maine’s rifle hunting season.

A fellow Army Reserve member said Card was a skilled marksman

Card was a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army.

Even though he was a certified firearms instructor, law enforcement officials told CNN, his time in the Army did not include training as a firearms instructor “nor did he serve in that capacity for the Army,” spokesperson Bryce Dubee said in a statement to CNN.

Still, Card had extensive training, including land navigation, making him “very comfortable in the woods,” said Clifford Steeves, who told CNN he knew Card when they both served in the Army Reserve.

He said Card is a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.

Investigators searched the suspect’s car Thursday and recovered a .308-caliber AR15 rifle. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will conduct tests to determine whether the gun can be matched to bullets and shell casings recovered at the two shooting scenes.

Steeves met Card in the early 2000s when they served together and knew him until about a decade ago, he said. Steeves said he didn’t notice any concerning behavior from Card, who he described as an “outdoors type of guy.”

“He was a very nice guy – very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”

Katie O’Neill, Card’s sister-in-law, told CNN he didn’t have a long history of mental health challenges.

“This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said, referring to his July hospitalization. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”

CNN —

A US Army reservist accused of killing 18 people and injuring 13 others in a shooting rampage in Maine this week was found dead Friday evening – apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot – after a two-day manhunt, a state official said.

Robert Card, accused of committing Wednesday’s massacre at a bowling alley and a restaurant in Lewiston, Maine, was found dead around 7:45 p.m. Friday near the Androscoggin River in the Lisbon Falls area, some 10 miles Lewiston, state Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck told reporters.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills said she is “breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that … Card is no longer a threat to anyone.”

“Now is a time to heal,” Mills, who said Maine State Police found the body, told reporters at the news conference. “Tonight, the city of Lewiston and the state of Maine begin to move forward on a long road to healing.”

Card’s body was found in an area near a recycling center from which he had recently been fired, a law enforcement source told CNN. Earlier this week, authorities had found Card’s vehicle abandoned after the shooting near a boat launch in the Lisbon area.

Details about when Card died still were being investigated, Sauschuck said, and authorities haven’t announced a motive in the shooting. Authorities intend to release more information Saturday morning about Card and the investigation, they said.

The discovery of Card’s body ends an intense two-day search that saw hundreds of officers scour parts of southern Maine by land, water and air, and finishes a period in which communities were simultaneously grieving and riddled with anxiety about the suspect’s location. Shelter-in-place orders for Androscoggin and northern Sagadahoc counties were in place from Wednesday night until they were lifted Friday afternoon, and schools, businesses and facilities were closed much of that time.

Part of the reason the search for Card was expanded to waterways: Authorities found a note from Card that indicated that he did not expect to be alive when the note was found, a law enforcement official told CNN.

The note essentially gave information to others about where things could be found and how things could be disposed of, the official said. Authorities had executed at least three search warrants Thursday on his vehicle, home and another property, the source said, which informed their search procedures Friday.

Wednesday evening’s shooting was the deadliest US mass shooting since last year’s massacre at a school in Uvalde, Texas.

Sources: Suspect bought gun legally days before psychiatric evaluation

Earlier Friday, multiple law enforcement sources told CNN the gun investigators believe Card used to carry out the massacre was purchased legally just days before he was hospitalized and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation in July.

In mid-July, New York State Police were called to Camp Smith in Cortlandt, New York, the military base where Card served, because he was acting “belligerently and possibly intoxicated,” according to a source briefed on the matter. Three law enforcement sources confirm state police brought Card to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for suspected intoxication and released the next day. When asked for information about the encounter, a New York State Police spokesperson told CNN: “This is an active investigation, and the New York State Police does not comment on active investigations.”

A federal law enforcement source told CNN the army gave Card a “Command Referral” to seek treatment after he told army personnel at Camp Smith Card had been “hearing voices” and had thoughts about “hurting other soldiers.” A National Guard spokesperson confirmed to CNN Card was transported to the nearby Keller Army Community Hospital at the United States Military Academy for “medical evaluation,” after Army Reserve officials reported Card for “behaving erratically.”

Card’s encounters with New York State Police and his National Guard superiors occurred just 10 days after Card had purchased the high-powered rifle at a Maine gun store, according to law enforcement sources. The rifle was a Ruger SFAR chambered for high-powered .308 ammunition, the sources added. The .308 round is favored by military snipers firing at long distances and big game hunters. It is larger and more powerful than the regular ammunition carried in the rifles of soldiers and SWAT teams.

Sources say the weapon found inside Card’s 2013 white Subaru Outback appears to be the same one fired by the gunman at the bowling alley and a local bar, though a ballistics match has not been confirmed. The weapon will be processed by the FBI and ATF for fingerprints and DNA and then run through laboratory testing to determine if the bullets and shell casings found at the scene match.

In the same July purchase, along with the rifle, sources say Card also bought a Beretta 92-F 9mm semi-automatic pistol. It is the standard pistol of the US military.

Deceased victims were 14 to 76 years old

The horror began around 7 p.m. Wednesday in Lewiston, where authorities say Card opened fire at Just-in-Time Recreation and then later at Schemengees Bar & Grille. Police were on the scene within just minutes of 911 calls made from the shooting locations, they said.

In addition to the 18 people killed, 13 others were injured, the Maine governor said Thursday.

Authorities identified all deceased victims Friday and said all their families had been notified. The oldest killed was a 76-year-old man and the youngest was a 14-year-old boy bowling with his father.

The victims are Tricia Asselin, William Frank Brackett, Peyton Brewer-Ross, Thomas “Tommy” Conrad, Michael Deslauriers II, Jason Walker, Keith Macneir, Bryan MacFarlane, Ronald “Ron” Morin Arthur “Artie” Strout, Joseph “Joey” Walker, Joshua Seal, Maxx Hathaway, Robert “Bob” Violette, Lucille Violette, Stephen “Steve” Vozzella, William “Bill” Young and his son Aaron Young.

Sources: Investigators developed working theory on why locations were targeted

Authorities searched two days across southern Maine for the suspect. Before Card’s body was found, authorities Friday still were urging residents across a 700-square-mile area to be vigilant as authorities raced to apprehend him.

Live Updates: Manhunt continues after Maine shooting rampage

Before Card was found dead, investigators had recovered a cell phone that belonged to Card, a law enforcement official said Friday. It added to the challenges for investigators, who routinely track cell phones to find suspects.

During the search, a CNN team saw officers surrounding a greenhouse late Friday morning at Springworks Farm in Lisbon, which is less than a mile from a boat launch where Card’s vehicle was found. Officers cleared the scene by noon.

And while the motive for the massacre remained unannounced Friday evening, a key theory about why the bowling alley and the restaurant were targeted emerged during the investigation, law enforcement sources say.

Card recently broke up with a longtime girlfriend, and investigators are pursuing a theory that Card went to the bowling alley and the bar because they were places the couple used to frequent, law enforcement sources told CNN’s John Miller.

Investigators believe the ex-girlfriend had signed up to play in a tournament at the bar Wednesday night, the sources said. According to the Facebook page for Schemengees Bar and Grill, Wednesday is “Industry Night,” which draws employees from other bars and restaurants in the Lewiston area.

Now that authorities know Card is dead, a hunting restriction that was in place for four communities because of the manhunt has been lifted, Sauschuck said Friday night. The lifting of the restriction in Lewiston, Lisbon, Bowdoin and Monmouth comes in time for Saturday’s opening of Maine’s rifle hunting season.

A fellow Army Reserve member said Card was a skilled marksman

Card was a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army.

Even though he was a certified firearms instructor, law enforcement officials told CNN, his time in the Army did not include training as a firearms instructor “nor did he serve in that capacity for the Army,” spokesperson Bryce Dubee said in a statement to CNN.

Still, Card had extensive training, including land navigation, making him “very comfortable in the woods,” said Clifford Steeves, who told CNN he knew Card when they both served in the Army Reserve.

He said Card is a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.

Investigators searched the suspect’s car Thursday and recovered a .308-caliber AR15 rifle. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will conduct tests to determine whether the gun can be matched to bullets and shell casings recovered at the two shooting scenes.

Steeves met Card in the early 2000s when they served together and knew him until about a decade ago, he said. Steeves said he didn’t notice any concerning behavior from Card, who he described as an “outdoors type of guy.”

“He was a very nice guy – very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”

Katie O’Neill, Card’s sister-in-law, told CNN he didn’t have a long history of mental health challenges.

“This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said, referring to his July hospitalization. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”

Next meeting scheduled for Nov 6, giving members another week to review draft report.","The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affair postponed its adoption of a draft report on three Bills seeking to replace the existing criminal laws, after pressure from the Opposition seeking more time to examine it. According to sources, the English version of the draft report was circulated just last week and the Hindi version was sent to members of the Parliamentary panel only on Thursday evening, just hours before the adoption of the report was slated at Friday’s meeting of the panel. According to sources, three members — Congress MPs Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary and Digivijay Singh, along with Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MP N.R. Elango — have so far filed dissent notes. They are demanding several changes in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 that will replace the Indian Penal Code, and the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 that will replace the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). More dissent notes are expected to follow. Draft report accepts Hindi namesOne of the key points of contention, the Hindi nomenclature of the Bills, has not been accepted in the draft reports circulated so far. The panel’s report on the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, states that since the text of the Bill is in English, it does not violate the provisions of Article 348 of the Constitution, which says that the language to be used in the Supreme Court and High Courts as well as for Acts, Bills, and other legal documents shall be English.The panel’s draft report has accepted a host of suggestions on the Bharatiya Sakshya, 2023 that is meant to replace the Indian Evidence Act; there is unanimity on that portion of the draft report. The panel began its consultations on the three bills on August 24, with a presentation by Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla. Including Friday’s meeting, it has held 12 meetings on the three Bills. According to Opposition members, this is highly inadequate, considering the scale and scope of the Bills. ‘Stop bulldozing Bills’According to sources, a few minutes after Friday’s meeting began, the panel’s chairman and BJP MP Brijlal told the members that the draft reports slated to be adopted at the meeting as per the circulated agenda would be withheld.
